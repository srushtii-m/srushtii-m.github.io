<p align="justify">
Hello, I’m Srushti Manjunath, a Data Scientist and Industrial Engineer with over four years of experience applying optimization, advanced machine learning, and generative AI across finance, technology, and operations. I build end to end AI systems spanning data engineering, model development, and MLOps that turn complex data into decisions and accelerate workflows. My work blends extensive analytics with scalable deployment to deliver reliable products and measurable business impact.
</p>

### **Academic Background**
<p align="justify">
With a Master’s degree in Industrial Engineering with Advanced Analytics from UIUC, I have honed a robust skill set in deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), graph neural networks (GNN), and reinforcement learning, equipping me to tackle complex, data-centric problems effectively.
</p>

### **Professional Expertise**
<p align="justify">
I build and ship LLM powered applications and analytics platforms on AWS and GCP with Kubernetes, combining NLP, representation learning, and graph methods with strong data engineering and observability. At Wells Fargo I delivered retrieval augmented generation systems, multi agent analytics, and evaluation frameworks with guardrails for safety and compliance. At Genpact I developed contact center language understanding and marketing analytics. At Amazon I improved demand forecasting and inventory planning using time series modeling and scalable pipelines. I focus on clean data foundations, continuous integration and delivery, cost aware inference, and rigorous measurement so solutions are reliable, efficient, and easy to operate.
